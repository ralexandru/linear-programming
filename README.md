# linear-programming
This repository will contain different computer implementations to solve linear programming problems.

Updates:
-----------
02/07/2022 - Added the computer implementation of Simplex Algorithm (using Java)

-------------------------------------
Simplex Algorithm implemented in Java
-------------------------------------
Inside this repository you will find the whole project of the Simplex implementation using Java. The class created in order to solve LP problems using Simplex is the SimpexTest class. 
The project also contains a GUI and a login/register system that connects to a database.
Password are encrypted using the EncryptPassword class and the connection to the database is made using the Database class.
Code comments are atm in my native language(Romanian) but I'll update them into english soon.
