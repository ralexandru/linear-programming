Inside this repository you will find the whole project of the Simplex implementation using Java. The class created in order to solve LP problems using Simplex is the SimpexTest class. 
The project also contains a GUI and a login/register system that connects to a database.
Password are encrypted using the EncryptPassword class and the connection to the database is made using the Database class.
